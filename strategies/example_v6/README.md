# Example v6 Strategy

This example demonstrates a copy/paste-ready Pine Script v6 strategy that uses limit-order-first entries, per-day trade gating, confirmation on bar close, and cancel/timeout handling for unfilled orders.

Use `example_v6.pine` as a starting point, then run:

```bash
npm run lint:pine
npm test
```

to validate changes before opening a pull request.
